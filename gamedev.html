                Rue[Acceptance Level] is another team project I worked on in my second level design class. The premise of this project was that you, a man whose husband has died
                have to go through the different stages of grief while on drugs. I designed my "level" concept with multiple levels in the Unreal Engine, but they all conveyed my
                part of the Acceptance stage in the psychedelic/abstract manner my group was going for. For this project I was the team's designated mechanics programmer
                as well as being assigned part 2 of the Acceptance level to design and create as I saw fit, I was able to set up the AI, the in-game UI, the ziplines, the PC's abilities etc. and
                due to my greater level of experience this time around, I was able to try to convey a narrative and implement some quality of life improvements to the game 
                such as multidirectional movement, and dynamic footstep sounds depending on the surface the player steps on etc.

                    Killer Karens [Storeroom Level] was and is the first video game level I ever developed. It's functions include but are not limited to, Enemy AI, FPS gameplay w/
                    Iron Sights, Ammo Pickups, Health Pickups, Grenades and more and I developed these during a Game Level Design course on my surface pro laptop. The overall project 
                    was a team effort, there was a Coffee Shop level, an Alleyway level, a Bathroom level, and a Storeroom level and the overarcing narrative was that you, a coffee shop 
                    worker are defending yourself against "Killer Karens" who are constantly attacking and harassing you and will not stop until you defeat them all.
