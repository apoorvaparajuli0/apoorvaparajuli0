            Rue[Acceptance Level] is another team project I worked on in my second level design class. The premise of this project was that you have a man whose husband dies
            and you go through the different stages of grief while on drugs. I designed my level with multiple physical "levels" in the Unreal Engine, but they all conveyed my
            part of the Acceptance stage adequately and in the psychedelic/abstract manner my group was going for. For this project I was the team's designated mechanics programmer
            as well as being assigned part 2 of the Acceptance level to design and create as I saw fit, I set up the AI, the in-game UI, the ziplines, the PC's abilities etc. 
            Due to my greater level of experience this time around, I was able to actually convey a narrative and implement some quality of life improvements to the game 
            such as multidirectional movement, and dynamic footstep sounds depending on the surface the player steps on etc.

        <p id="KKDescription"> 
            Killer Karens [Storeroom Level] was and is the first video game level I ever developed by myself. It's functions include but are not limited to, Enemy AI, FPS gameplay w/
            Iron Sights, Ammo Pickups, Health Pickups, Grenades and more and I developed all of these myself in the span of approximately four months during a Game Level Design
            course on my surface pro laptop. The overall project was a team effort, there was a Coffee Shop level, an Alleyway level, a Bathroom level, and a Storeroom level and I worked the 
            storeroom level and all of the mechanics within it. The overall "narrative" was, you, a coffee shop worker are defendning yourself against "Killer Karens" who are 
            constantly attacking and harassing you and will not stop until you defeat them all.
