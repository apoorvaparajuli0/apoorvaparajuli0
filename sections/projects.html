            Rue[Acceptance Level] is another team project I worked on in my 
            second level design class. The premise of this project was that 
            you, a man whose husband has died have to go through the different 
            stages of grief while on drugs. I designed my "level" concept with 
            multiple levels in the Unreal Engine, but they all conveyed my part 
            of the Acceptance stage in the psychedelic/abstract manner my group 
            was going for. For this project I was the team's designated mechanics 
            programmer as well as being assigned part 2 of the Acceptance level 
            to design and create as I saw fit, I was able to set up the AI, the in-game UI, 
            the ziplines, the PC's abilities etc. and due to my greater level of experience 
            this time around, I was able to try to convey a narrative and implement some quality 
            of life improvements to the game such as multidirectional movement, and dynamic footstep 
            sounds depending on the surface the player steps on etc.

            Killer Karens [Storeroom Level] was and is the first video game level I ever 
            developed. It's functions include but are not limited to, Enemy AI, FPS gameplay 
            w/ Iron Sights, Ammo Pickups, Health Pickups, Grenades and more and I developed 
            these during a Game Level Design course on my surface pro laptop. The overall 
            project was a team effort, there was a Coffee Shop level, an Alleyway level, a 
            Bathroom level, and a Storeroom level and the overarcing narrative was that you, 
            a coffee shop worker are defending yourself against "Killer Karens" who are constantly 
            attacking and harassing you and will not stop until you defeat them all.
