            From April of 2024 to October, I was working as a full-stack developer on this project.
            I led development on the frontend and have also worked extensively on the backend 
            of the application, as well as on deployment. This product is intended to be able to 
            take and process news articles provided by a user and parse the article content into 
            facts and opinions and generate analytics on the facts and opinions (such as the percentage 
            of each present in the article). This product is in development and there are more features
            planned.

            I began development on this web application prior to beginning my work at the AAPI Coalition, 
            and am working on extending and improving the application to better serve the needs of the 
            CoCo (Contra Costa) AAPI Coalition & an independent community support group that also has need for it. 
            This application is under development but is still currently accessible. The features planned include 
            but are not limited to data storage, filtration, parsing, generating analytics on data, and secure 
            data export features.
